STARTUP GUIDE
=============

1. OSRM setup

	git clone https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend.git
	cd osrm-backend
	mkdir -p build
	cd build
	cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-Wno-error=array-bounds"
	cmake --build .

2. Move map to osrm-backend/maps/magin/map_magin.osm

3. Set up OSRM

	./osrm-extract -p ../profiles/car.lua ~/codebase/osrm-backend/maps/magin/map_magin.osm
	./osrm-partition /home/c0debaberafa/codebase/osrm-backend/maps/magin/map_magin
	./osrm-customize /home/c0debaberafa/codebase/osrm-backend/maps/magin/map_magin




RUNNING / TESTING
=================

4. Running OSRM server

	./osrm-routed --algorithm mld ../maps/magin/map_magin

5. Run simulation

	python3 -m venv venv
	source venv/bin/activate
	python3 __main__.py


6. Run visualization

	(inside generator/, using venv)
	flask --app server run --port=5050

	(inside visualization/)
	serve .



CHANGELOG
=========

5/2/25 - R
	read through code, very minor tweaks

5/3/25 - R
	fix roaming implementation
	generate initial roaming graphs
	turn off watch history and recommendations

	passenger status enum
		added to create passenger status

	passenger class
		added status field
			updated scenarios/real to update status

	entities.py/tricycle
		findNearbyPassengers() - to detect passengers within accepted pickup radius
			in - self, passengers, radius*
			out - nearby (list of nearby passengers / closest passenger)

	scenarios/real.py/simulator/processframe
		tricycle loop - include nearby passenger detection and pickup

	simulation

5/5/25 - R
	fixed visualization

	for next session:
		fix visualization
			add terminal markers
			update text
				tricycles
					current passengers
				passengers
					status
		roaming
			pure roaming setup


5/6/25 - R

	dashboard.py
		take a look
	visualization updates
		show run metadata
		indicate terminal locations
			would need to export terminal locations in simulation output
				* more understanding of how run simulation is done
	roaming implementation
		figure out how all passengers can be picked up eventually
			if not, this would be skewed. take NOTE

	========

	dashboard.py
		took a look
	visualization updates
		created time and location data to events for tricycles
			for passengers?
		updated visualization code
			show passenger spawn and status
				custom passenger icons, colored per status
					waiting - red
					enqueued - orange
					onboard - yellow
					completed - green
			show event pop ups
				appear
				load
				wait
				drop-off
	roamming implementation

5/7/25

	updated visualization
		trikes now indicate passengers inside
		event markers for pick up and drop off
		event log
	updated entities, basically to make generated data as real as possible
		pickup / dropoff proximity instead of grid detection

5/8/25 2PM - 10PM

	review pickup dropoff proximity functions and simulate
		fix checkPassengers -> instead of immediately loading, travel to that point. same for drop off
			separated terminal passengers from roaming passengers
				roaming trikes only pick up along the road
				non roaming can pick up both along the road and at terminals
				* consider including terminal pickup but only if there is no line. this is realistic?
					also i think it fixes the error from the last simulation. we're coming full circle.
		fix wait handling -> it doesnt seem like trikes are waiting 500ms either in the simulation or in the visualization
	visualization updates
		simulation parameters -- modify metadata.json
		indicate simulation parameters / output
		add simulation parameters / output 
			passengers delievered
			passengers waiting
		fix passenger event handling
			do we even need status?
		check trike event handling
			should they all have finish trip?
	graphing
		dashboard.py modification


5/9/25
	quite a bit
	a few things to consider
		passenger spawn
			currently all spawn at terminal
		roaming tricycle behavior
			currently terminals are endpoints for roaming paths
			allow to pick up at terminals, as long as no tricycle is lined up?
			allow pick up of passengers, even during SERVING? 
		nonroaming tricycle behavior
			allow tricycles to pickup along the road for RETURNING TO TERMINAL?
	visualization
		roaming endpoints -> large blue circle
		update trike tooltip to only show passenger indices
		tricycle status log
			change moving marker color based on status?
		pause / play?
